# What is Lochwynne University?
Lochwynne University is an institute created to train young Dretons (those who possess superhuman abilities) in controlling and growing their abilities and to promote a healthy relationship between Nulls (those who dont have any supernatural abilities) and Dretons. 

Users will be able to create a character to battle online against another user or against AI. The users character progression will depend on the outcome of the battle and the character progression will be saved for future battles.
